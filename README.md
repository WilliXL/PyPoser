# PyPoser!

A Probability-Driven Music Composer Written in Python

This is for Carnegie Mellon University's F16 15-112 Term Project.


# External Libraries
- PySynth for generating the music
- PyAudio for playing music
- PyDub for wrapping PyAudio so that it can create a WAV overlay for playing two WAV files at the same time

Documentation and download/installation instructions for the libraries can be found at:
- https://mdoege.github.io/PySynth/
- https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/
- http://pydub.com/

The three libraries are easily installed with pip. Once the three libraries are installed (make sure that PyDub is installed after PyAudio as it is a dependency) the program should be ready to run.
