# PyPoser!

A Probability-Driven Music Composer Written in Python

This is for Carnegie Mellon University's F16 15-112 Term Project.

The libraries that I use are: 
- PySynth for generating the music
- PyAudio for playing music
- PyDub for wrapping PyAudio so that it can create a WAV overlay for playing two WAV files at the same time
